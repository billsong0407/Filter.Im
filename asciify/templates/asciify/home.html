    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p> Filter.im is a web application that allows you to upload an image and apply image filters to it.
        The filtering effect is achieved by 2D image convolution. 
        Available transformation effects include edge detection, sharpening, embossing, blurring, etc.</p>

    <h2> Image convolution </h2>
    <p> Image convolution is a two-dimensional convolution operation in image processing. It is a favored technique 
        used in image processing and object detection.
    </p>
    <p> The convolution process onto an image applies a kernel over each pixel and its local neighbors across the entire
        image. The kernel is a square matrix of values to determine the transformation effect on an image
    </p>
    <p> Many mathematical theories and models can be achieved using image convolution. These models can
        be executed in matrix form for digital image processing, recognized as image convolution kernel.
